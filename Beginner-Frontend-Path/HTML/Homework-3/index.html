        <h1>Subway Cookie</h1>
        <p>
          It’s ironic that my favorite cookie comes from a sandwich shop.If you’ve never tried one of Subway’s famous cookies, you haven’t lived.

              Subway Cookie Ingredients
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>White and Brown Sugar</b>- White sugar keeps the edges crispy, whereas brown sugar keeps the center soft and chewy. </li>
                <li><b>Canola oil</b>- Either canola oil or vegetable oil, as they are neutral tasting. If you’d like to use butter or vegan butter, you are free to use that too. </li>
                <li><b>Milk of choice</b>- Any milk of choice will work, like almond, soy, or any other milk. </li>
                <li><b>Vanilla Extract</b>- A must for good cookie or dessert recipe! I love how it gives the cookies a subtle vanilla flavor. </li>
                <li><b>All Purpose Flour</b>- Sift your flour before using it, to ensure no clumps remain. I used gluten free all purpose flour, to keep it gluten free. </li>
                <li><b>Baking Powder and Baking Soda</b>- Leavens out the cookies, gives them a little rise, and allows them to spread well. </li>
                <li><b>Salt</b>- Brings out the sweetness of the cookies.</li>        
                <li><b>White Chocolate Chips</b>- Use good quality white chocolate chips, as sometimes they can be a little waxy. </li> 
                <li><b>Macadamia Nuts</b>- Adds some crunch and pairs beautifully with the white chocolate. Roughly chop the nuts, to mix well into the cookie dough.</li>                         
            </ul>
